		You are sush a special 'Friend' in my life.Thanks for being everytime you support & encourages me.
		I am very lucky to have a beautiful & good friend in my life. Yes sometimes I get jealous when other pepole try to be best friend with you. all off sudden you are very far to me sometines that time I felt like very sad and that time  I feel like I did't talk to you this is the reason sometimes I did't talk to you.we both spend very less time but I am so attached with you. I don't know the why
		and Finally may be together we don't have lot of pictures but we together have sweet & unforgetable memories.
